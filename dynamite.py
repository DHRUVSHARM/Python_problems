"""
Given is a d1 Ã— d2 array of integer values, representing a maze. One cell is marked as
the entry point. Another cell is marked as the exit point. The remainder of the cells are
either open, or blocked. You enter the maze with one stick of dynamite, that can be used
on any blocked location to convert it into an open location. Give an O(d1d2) algorithm
that determines the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point that uses no more
than one stick of dynamite.
