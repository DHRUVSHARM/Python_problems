Problem 1 (20 points: 12 for implementation / 8 for writeup)
You are trying to get home in time to attend your sisterâ€™s opening night performance. You have
limited time and limited money to do so. Given is an undirected graph G, containing n nodes and
m edges. One of these nodes is your current location. Another of the nodes is your destination.
Each edge represents a potential travel route from one location to another. Each edge has two
positive integer values associated with it: a monetary cost (any integer greater than or equal to 1)
as well as a time cost (either a 1, 2 or 3) to travel along that edge.
Design an O(mn) algorithm that determines whether it is possible for you to safely reach your
destination without exceeding your budget or being late for the performance.
